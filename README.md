ðŸ˜„ Hi, I'm Adib. I am graduated in graphic design and for some years I work in the IT area initially in support and infrastructure. I have a technical course in computer networks and I am currently doing a new degree in technology in internet systems. I really enjoy reading, listen to kpop, online games and going to the movies or watching movies at home. I fell in love with front-end development for some time and I am studying, adding my love for design and now for web development.
